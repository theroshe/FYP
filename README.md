This project was developed as part of my final year of unviersity. 

I explored the possibility of modifying GCC to implement processor specific features (particularly compiler support for ARM Cortex M3 Bit Banding).

The plugin directory contains the bit_band plugin, which adds support originally found in armcc.

Developing gcc plugins requires a copy of gcc with plugin support enabled. If you need one, use install-gcc.sh to install one in the "install" directory.
